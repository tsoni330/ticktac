A privacy policy is a legal document that outlines how user data is collected, used, and protected. In the case of an app that doesn't collect or use any user data, you still need a privacy policy to inform users of this fact and to comply with various privacy regulations. Here's a template for a privacy policy for an app that doesn't contain any user data:

We understand and respect your privacy, and we have designed our app to operate without any data collection.

Third-Party Services

While we do not collect any user data, our app may use third-party services such as analytics or advertising networks. These third parties may have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. However, they do not collect personal data from our app.

Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will delete such information from our systems.
